  "description": "Core period-finding subroutine of Shor's algorithm: find the period r of f(x) = 7^x mod 15.",
  "long_description": "Shor's algorithm factors integers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. The key subroutine is quantum period finding: given f(x) = a^x mod N, find the smallest r such that a^r \u2261 1 (mod N). For a=7, N=15: r=4 (7\u00b9=7, 7\u00b2=4, 7\u00b3=13, 7\u2074=1 mod 15). QPE on the modular exponentiation unitary gives output 0, 2, 4, 6 (multiples of 2^n/r=4). This circuit is a pedagogical simplification; production circuits require full modular exponentiation with ~100 gates for N=15.",
